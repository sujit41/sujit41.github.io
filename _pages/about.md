## About Me
I am Sujit Kumar, an undergraduate student of Mathematics at Kirorimal College, University of Delhi. My primary academic interests lie in **Computable Analysis (particularly the Type-2 Theory of Effectivity approach)**, Functional Analysis, Approximation Theory, and Complex Geometry.

My curiosity in mathematics is driven by a desire to understand the foundational aspects of computation over real numbers and infinite objects. I am especially interested in the interaction between analysis and logic, and how abstract mathematical structures can be studied through a computational lens.


## Research Interests

- Computable Analysis (TTE approach)
- Functional Analysis
- Approximation Theory
- Complex Geometry
- Mathematical Foundations of Computation

## Academic Goals

I aspire to pursue postgraduate studies (M.Sc. and Ph.D.) in pure mathematics, with the long-term goal of contributing to research in analysis and its computational foundations.
