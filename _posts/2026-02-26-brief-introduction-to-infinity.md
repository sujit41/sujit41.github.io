## About This Work

This paper provides a historical and conceptual overview of infinity, tracing its development from ancient Indian philosophy and Jain mathematics to Bhaskara II’s insights on division by zero and infinite processes.

It also discusses the philosophical distinction between potential and actual infinity in Greek thought, and briefly highlights Cantor’s revolutionary contribution to modern set theory.

The aim of this exposition is to present infinity not merely as a symbol, but as a structural concept that reshaped mathematics.
